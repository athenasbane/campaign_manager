    title: "Pre-History",
    summary: `It's important to note that the nature of this era before the separation of the planes is shrouded in mystery and often veiled in myth and metaphor. The formation of the prime material plane is a subject of philosophical speculation, religious beliefs, and arcane theories across various cultures and planes of existence, each providing their own unique interpretations of this primordial epoch.
    However, there are commonalities in the creation myths of the various cultures that may shead some light on the origins of Teratin. One of these is that this was a time there was no such thing as the many planes of existance that we know now. In fact, it's believed that there was only one plane of roiling elemental energy. As the planes started to seperate the energy sources for these elemental forces began to recede.

    title: "The Dawn",
    summary: `The "Dawn of Consciousness" marks a profound and pivotal epoch in the cosmic history, following the formation of the prime material plane and the establishment of the foundational realms. During this epoch, sentient awareness emerged, bringing with it the birth of individual and collective consciousness across the multiverse.

    At the outset of this epoch, the prime material plane and its myriad realms were inhabited by an array of life forms, ranging from simple organisms to complex and intelligent beings. These beings were initially driven by instinct and primal urges, responding to the rhythms of the natural world. However, a subtle and transformative shift occurred as certain species began to exhibit signs of self-awareness and introspection.
    
    The emergence of consciousness was a gradual and intricate process, fueled by a combination of environmental pressures, genetic mutations, and the interplay of cosmic energies. Over countless generations, beings developed a heightened capacity for perception, cognition, and self-reflection. This newfound awareness allowed them to contemplate their surroundings, ponder their own existence, and even delve into the mysteries of the cosmos.`,

    title: "The Age of Dreki",
    summary: `During this time the dominant race on Tordenhelm, and Teratin in its entirety, was dragons. Unlike the stories of dragons today dragons in this time lived communally had a generally gerontocratic (The oldest lead) leadership structure.
    Although immortal, their motivations would be understandable to mortals of today they hunted, farmed and had children. They sort to make the world a better place for their offspring.
    Unlike today the planes were far closer together so the dragons regularly had to band together to fight wars against fiendish and elemental incursions forcing dragon society to be quite militaristic but they longed for prolonged peace.
    Dragon’s were often brought into the schemes of deities that during this time wondered the lands.`,

    title: "The Fall of Dragonkind",
    summary: `It’s not certain when this originally happened but it is presumed it was a plan centries in the making. Lovlig infiltrated dragon society and bore offspring that in turn borne a new race of dragons. They bided their time until many of the great heroes of the previous generations had fallen in battle. Then they struck revolting against their parents and their rulership, slaughtering all that were not cursed such as them.
    This new bread of dragon was greedy and isolationist. They had a singleminded goal of acquiring wealth at all costs. So after initially working together to throw off their parents rule they turned on each other.
    This blood curse was incurable and none of the unaffiliated older dragons knew who among them were carriers of the it. They begged the gods to remove the affliction from their bloodlines once and for all. One God Villious the Arch-deity of life and stability took pity on them and did what they could.
    The next line of dragons would be free of the curse but would give up their greatest gift… their immortality. The remaining dragons agreed, and some of those that had living mates bore children in smaller eggs these were the first dragonborne.
    What became of the remaining dragons is now lost to history but I is believed by some they are still out there or that they were eventually hunted down and killed by their children vengeful children.

    title: "The Dark Covergence",
    summary: `The fall of dragonkind created a power vacuum that destabilized the delicate balance of the multiverse. As a result, the barriers between planes of existence weakened, leading to frequent and unpredictable breaches between the material plane and other dimensions. These breaches allowed malevolent entities, extraplanar creatures, and elemental forces to spill into the prime material plane, wreaking havoc upon its landscapes and inhabitants.
    Unchecked, fiends used Teratin as a soul farm for their soul engines. Subjugation of the sapient mortal races was almost total.

The heroes' actions not only liberated their world from the grip of interplanar oppression but also forever altered the cosmic balance, as they themselves transcended mortal limitations to become deities.`,

The Old Gods before this time were respected, the Tip Lords ruled in their Dominions free of Imperial interference. The Nals project was fast tracked using the newly found blasphemous as prison labour to complete them. This was met with sometimes disastrous results. The flooding of Shamphel (Now Shambles). The Wild Lands wars saw the complete breakdown of relationship between the Moving Cities and Torden. To the point that the Empire denies their existence to this very day`,

    title: "The Breaking of the Imperium",
    summary: `The Tordenhelm Rebellion began when Imperial forces, already weakened, were overrun by a Daemonic invasion. In the chaos, long-oppressed factions rose against their masters, including the Cirrane Republican Army (CRA), the Prannian Tribes, and The Raven of New Shamphel. The Imperium collapsed under the onslaught, leaving its remnants undefended and the fledgling nations to face the Daemons alone. In this crucible, The Five—also known as Birbick’s Bastards—forged alliances and struck down the invasion’s leaders, culminating in the destruction of Hildraugr, the Lord of Death. Though the Divine Barrier remained shattered, one of the Five sacrificed themselves to restore it. In the aftermath, Balfor ascended to divinity, taking the Domain of Leader within the mortal Five, replacing the fallen god Zucleith.`,

    title: "The Age of Smoke",
    summary:
      "In the two centuries following the Tordenhelm Rebellion, the collapse of the Imperium and the Daemonic Invasion left the continent fractured. With the Divine Barrier restored and the Daemons banished, the survivors turned to rebuilding. Power shifted from crowns and priesthoods to merchant houses and industrialists, laying the foundation for the early arcano-tech revolution. The Cirrane Republic, forged in the fires of rebellion, became a major democratic power along the coast, though plagued by piracy and political factionalism. New Shamphel, reborn from The Shambles through the heroism of The Raven, grew into a sprawling metropolis—its revolutionary legacy gradually replaced by corporate dominance. Viirvashness secured its place as a neutral financial hub, mediating trade and investment between rival powers. The fall of Imperial authority in the Mere Lands and other frontier regions opened the way for corporate exploitation. Periwinkel Industries and Spire Arcano-Tech emerged as the dominant forces, monopolizing aetheric crystal extraction and mass-producing enchanted goods. Arcano-tech replaced traditional magic in much of daily life, even as it deepened the divide between rich and poor. In the absence of centralized control, new nations rose from former Imperial provinces—some adopting democracy like the Cirrane Republic, others ruled by oligarchs, warlords, or monarchs. The surviving city of Torden became an ossified relic under the still-reigning Empero, whose belief in the Imperium’s restoration persists in defiance of reality. By the dawn of the Age of Smoke, railways and aetheric engines had reshaped the land, industry choked the skies with soot, and the promise of freedom born from the Rebellion had long since faded into a world defined by profit, exploitation, and uneasy peace.",
