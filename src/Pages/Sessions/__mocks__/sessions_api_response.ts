The air is thick with the stench of damp and decay. As you stir, you feel the lingering effects of the previous night's excesses—aches and pains, a testament to drink and debauchery, gnawing at your body. Yet, beneath the physical discomfort, there's an unmistakable sense that something profound has shifted. It's nothing you can pinpoint, an elusive change that escapes definition, but its presence is undeniable. This realization brings with it a tumult of emotions, an inexplicable mix of exhilaration and trepidation that courses through your veins. The certainty of change, though intangible and nebulous, hangs heavy in the air, igniting a spark of curiosity about what lies ahead, even as it sends a shiver of fear down your spine. You're left to ponder, in the quiet before the storm, what fate has in store for you beyond these cold, unforgiving walls.",

Seraphiel, born in a small village, was destined to safeguard his community. He dedicated himself to Lathander and became a paladin, but he struggled with physical weakness and clumsiness. Although he could charm and deceive his way out of predicaments, his martial prowess was lacking. Despite his efforts, he yearned to be the beacon of light Lathander needed.",

                  "- Ratheon Vermon, the Piper of Decay, attacked.\n- He set the market place ablaze then called to him his disgusting minions: reanimated, giant dead rats.\n- Aphelios was surrounded by rats but used his spirit guardians to burn many of them away.\n- Heilig fought his way to Ratheon and managed to get some hits in but was hit back with a devastating necrotic blast and fell.\n- This however broke Ratheon’s concentration and Fane began to rouse from her slumber.\n- Chordy revived Atriox and cast the fly spell on him.\n- Once up he grappled Ratheon and flew him straight in the air.\n- Ratheon struggled but couldn’t get Atriox off of him.\n- Atriox rained down blows on him and dropped him.\n- Below Fane lined up a Warhammer blow that hit and splattered Ratheon across the market.\n- Fane then joined them back in the secret location in the maze.\n- They were given private rooms.\n- In the night Atriox was joined by Seraphina Grimshadow. She asked him to remember his passed. Atriox started too:\n    - He stood in an encampment and heard screams and stepped through into one of the tents. Inside he saw a minotaur solider with a dead tabaxi male at his feet. The solider turned and asked “is everything was ok general?” in a language that Atriox hadn’t heard in centuries?\n    - Then a sound was heard and a female come out behind him welding a knife towards the solider. A rune glowed on his armour and the women’s neck snapped and she slumped, dead presumably next to her mate.\n    - The solider laughed and said: “You were right to tell me to wear that rune general!”\n    - At this moment they heard a soft purring sound. Swaddled nearby was a tiny Tabaxi cub. The solider told Atriox to go he will stop him from having to dirty his hands with this duty.\n    - Atriox refused saying that he will do it.\n    - The solider left.\n    - Atriox looked around for anyone one else her and a female tabaxi appeared from hiding. Atriox tried to ask her if the child was hers but she didn’t understand his language. Atriox handed her the child and signed for her to go via the back exit.\n    - As she left through the back and Atroix through the front he heard a sound and the solider shout “Found you! They always try come through the back”. Joining them Atriox found the women dead he dropped down and, without the solider noticing, picked up the child and secreted it away in his armour.\n    - As Atriox walked away Seraphina appeared looking far older grabbing him and pulling him to the present.\n    - She was shocked and panicked and said that wasn’t a memory… that was the passed.\n    - She disappeared just before Serpantine and her guards appeared to find the intruder.",
